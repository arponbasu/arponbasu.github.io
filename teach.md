## Talks and Outreach
1. Instructed students (grades 8-12) on polynomials and functional equations for Math Olympiads, at a Mathematics Olympiad Orientation Program (December '23) conducted by AEES. Find the recordings of my talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlj1LZDXABU){:target="_blank"}, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1wt6IJM9io){:target="_blank"}.


## TAships
I have TA'd for 6 courses so far at IIT Bombay, and I've enjoyed this experience a lot. Among other things, my experience involved conducting tutorials (recitations), grading assignments and examination papers, and clearing student queries personally. Some courses I have TA'd for are:
1. MA109 (Calculus), Fall 2021
2. MA106 (Linear Algebra), Spring 2022
3. CS228 (Logic for Computer Science), Spring 2023: I prepared [LaTeXed solutions](https://github.com/arponbasu/CS228_Tut_Solutions){:target="_blank"} to the tutorials for this course, which were referred to by hundreds of juniors.
4. [CS215 (Data Analysis and Interpretation), Fall 2023](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS215_Fall2023/){:target="_blank"} 
5. [CS208 (Automata and Logic), Spring 2024](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~supratik/courses/cs208/index.html){:target="_blank"}
6. [CS786 (Randomized Algorithms), Spring 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/kumarakash/teaching/cs-786-randomized-algorithms?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}
