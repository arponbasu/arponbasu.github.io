You can find some songs I have sung on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsn6Dn-EZ0s36W1860jc0NQ" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>. This contains some Rabindrasangeet I've sung, and some inaugural songs at IIT Bombay convocations. I also completed a year-long course on Hindustani Classical music at IIT Bombay.<br>
